  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF's Terms and Conditions of Use</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Summary</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Hello. You should read these terms and conditions in full because they apply every time you visit POF and use any of its features. However, just in case you ever need a reminder of the main points, here’s a quick summary:</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If you are under the age of 18 then unfortunately you can’t use POF yet because it’s a meeting place for adults only.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We’re not responsible for anything that you post, live stream or say while you are on POF and we don’t monitor the content of the site, but if we do see or someone alerts us that you have posted something that we think is inappropriate then we are allowed at our discretion to remove it.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If you post any content that actually belongs to someone else and they get annoyed (or even call in their lawyers), we are not in the firing line. You have to take responsibility for what you post.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Please refer to our Community Guidelines and Safety Tips for additional Dos and Don’ts, and information on staying safe.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If you are concerned about how your data is being used by POF then please refer to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use POF. By using POF, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Our website and apps also use cookies or similar technologies which we tell you more about here. You may set your browser and your mobile settings to block cookies and local storage devices, but if you do so, you may not be able to access the features that POF offers.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The full legal bit</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF is a social media website and app designed as a forum for meeting new people, a place to have discussions and to share photos, live streaming, news and information. It is intended to be a fun place to visit and it is important to us (and for you) that it remains a safe and friendly environment so you agree that you will only use POF in a manner consistent with its purpose and which is in accordance with these terms and conditions, as well as the POF Community Guidelines and Safety Tips (the “Terms”). When we mention POF, we mean www.POF.com, together with affiliated websites and applications.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you as user (“you”) and the POF Group (“we” or “us”). The POF Group includes, but is not limited to, POF Trading Limited (an English company whose registered office is at The Broadgate Tower, Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London EC2A 2RS), Social Online Payments Limited (a company incorporated in Ireland under company number 496494) and Social Online Payments, Inc. (a company incorporated in Delaware under company number 5214252).</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The Terms apply whenever you visit POF, whether or not you have chosen to register with us, so please read them carefully. By accessing, using, registering for or receiving services offered on POF you are accepting and agreeing to be bound by the Terms.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP OR SITE.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">1. Use of the app and site and rules relating to Content</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Who can use POF?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF is a meeting place for adults. You may only use POF, including any of its features, or become a registered member if you are 18 years old or older (or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18).</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and be bound by the Terms and that by using POF you will not be violating any law or regulation of the country in which you are resident. You are solely responsible for your compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You further warrant that you have not been convicted of, nor are subject to any court order relating to assault, violence, sexual misconduct or harassment.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">What kind of content can I post or upload on POF?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You are able to post or upload all kinds of things on POF, including photographs, emails, messages, live streamed audiovisual content and other content (“Content”).</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">There are some rules about what is acceptable though, so when you are using POF you may not post, send or upload any Content which:</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">contains expletives or language which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">is obscene, pornographic or otherwise may offend human dignity;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">is abusive, insulting or threatening, or which promotes, depicts or encourages violence, self-harm, suicide, racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">is defamatory;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">involves the transmission of “junk” mail or “spam”;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">impersonates a person, company or brand with the intent to deceive or confuse others;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal data whether from POF or otherwise;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">itself, or the posting of which, infringes any third party’s rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">shows another person where such Content was created or distributed without that person’s knowledge, and without that person having been afforded an opportunity to refuse such creation or distribution; or</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">contains images of children, even if you are also in the photo, or endangers minors.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Please use your common sense when picking the Content that you choose to post on, upload or send via POF because you are solely responsible for, and bear all liability in relation to, such Content. If you repeatedly infringe our rules, you may be prevented from using POF and we may disable your account or block you from further use of POF. We may remove any Content you submit to POF if we believe it violates the Terms or we are required to do so by applicable law.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page (“Profile”) whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances. You are required to follow our Guidelines and Safety Tips when doing so.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">What about other people’s personal data, can I use it?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You may only use other POF users’ personal data to the extent that your use of it matches POF’s purpose of allowing people to meet one another. When using POF Live, you may not film other people, whether or not they are POF users, unless you have informed them that the footage will be livestreamed via POF Live and given them an opportunity to exclude themselves from the footage. You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. POF reserves the right to terminate your account, or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users' information.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Some of my friends want to see all the people I’m chatting with. Can I tell them my password and let them log on as me?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The short answer is no. Only you are authorised to access your account with POF. You must not share your password with anyone or let anyone else access your account as this jeopardises the security of all of the Content and personal data that you have submitted to POF. You are responsible for keeping your password secret and secure. If you don’t, POF is not liable for any unauthorised access to your account. If you suspect that someone has gained access to your account, you must let us know immediately by visiting Feedback page and telling us of your suspicions or concerns. You must also immediately change your password. POF reserves the right to terminate your account if you violate our rules on keeping your password secure.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Who can see the Content that I put on POF?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">When you upload Content to POF it can be accessed and viewed by the general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to POF. We reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to POF without any incurring liability to you. We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to POF, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to POF, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of POF.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Anything else I need to know?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">When you use POF you agree to the Terms, and in return we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable licence to use and to upload Content and to use POF solely for your personal use. Apart from this licence, you have no other rights in the use of the site, app, or its Content or features, and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any of the site or Content in any manner. If you breach any of the Terms, the above licence will terminate automatically and you must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Content.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">2. Ownership of Content</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Once I have uploaded Content on POF, do I still own it?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Yes (provided you are the rightful owner in the first place — please see our other rules regarding posting Content that doesn’t belong to you).</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Please note though that by posting, uploading or sending Content on POF you represent and warrant to us that:</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">you are either the exclusive author or owner of that Content and in all cases you agree that you waive any and all moral rights relating to that Content (including, without limitation, any rights to be identified as the author);</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">you have been granted a licence that allows you to use, post or upload the Content; or</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">you have obtained appropriate consent or authority to use, post or upload such Content.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Please note that by posting, uploading or sending Content on POF you represent and warrant to us that you have the right to do so, and automatically grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use such Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We may assign and/or sub-license the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any Content posted or uploaded by you to our app or site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights or of their right to privacy or any other law.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Who does the rest of the Content on POF belong to then?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Us! All text, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds and artwork on POF are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Can I use any of the Content that doesn’t belong to me?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Other than in relation to Content submitted by you to POF, you do not have any rights in relation to the Content on POF and you agree that you will not use any Content in any manner which may infringe ours or any third party’s rights. This means that you agree that you will not copy, modify, adapt, distribute, publish or sell all or any part of the POF site or the Content contained on it (other than the Content submitted by you) to anyone else.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">3. Paid for services</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">What can I buy on POF?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF offers you the opportunity to pay for certain services offered on the site. POF’s premium services include various opportunities to find and meet additional people, to customise your profile and to boost your profile so more people find you. POF also offers the ability to play various games on the site. All of these premium services can be purchased after you register, and you may subscribe to the premium services for various lengths of time.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Once you have paid for any premium services, you have the right to cancel and be reimbursed for all payments received within 14 days. If you wish to cancel please let us know via Feedback Page. Please note that if you choose to download any of the Content which forms part of any paid for service within the 14 day period, you may lose this right. After the 14 days have expired, the paid for services are non-refundable.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You can change your Auto Top-up at anytime in your payment settings on your profile page. The pricing may vary due to a number of factors, such as (but not limited to) promotional offers, loyalty bonuses and other discounts.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Paid for services are not available in sanctioned countries.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">How do I renew my premium services with POF?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Once you have requested a POF premium service, you authorise POF to charge your chosen payment method. If you want to cancel or change your payment method at any time, you can do either via the payment settings option under your profile or by contacting your mobile service provider. If your chosen payment method is via your mobile service provider, then please check with them about their payment terms, as their payment terms will govern how payments to POF are made as well as how such payments may be changed or cancelled. Your subscription to POF’s premium services will automatically renew until you decide to cancel, and if you have enabled the Auto Top-up feature, your account will automatically be topped up until you decide to disable this feature.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Can I transfer any of my paid for services to another POF user?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">If you elect to partake in any of the games, premium features or range of services designed to improve your POF user experience, you agree to use these services for yourself and not to transfer (for free or as a sale) to or purchase, or sell such services from other POF users. POF reserves the right not to honour any paid for services where you have attempted to transfer those services to another use or you have attempted to buy those services from another user. POF will only provide paid for services to you if you are the person to whom it was issued.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Do my credits last forever?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">No. We reserve the right to expire any unused credits expire 6 months (unless the credits are purchased through Itunes). If you delete your account or if your account is terminated by us due to breach of these Terms, you will lose any accumulated credits. If you receive free or promotional credits, we may expire them at any time. Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Please refer to the Service Conditions on your ‘top-up’ page for further details relating to your payments.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">4. Access to the app and site</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Do you guarantee that POF will be up and running at all times?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Unfortunately we can’t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so POF is provided on an “as is” “as available” basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of POF and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on POF without notice and without incurring any liability to you.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">What about mobile access?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access POF (including, but not limited to Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and, any other charges associated with such access). We shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as result of or in connection with accessing POF through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">By accessing POF or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from POF through your mobile phone and/or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">I’m not registered and I can’t seem to access some Content or features on the app or site. Why is that?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Non-registered users are able to access only that portion of POF that is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload any Content. The extent of registered users’ access to POF will depend on certain criteria relating to their Profile being met. We may change or update the criteria from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">5. Lookalikes</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">How does Lookalikes work?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Lookalikes is one feature of the site which is primarily designed to allow you to find people who look similar to celebrities, friends or even you!

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">How does POF Live work?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF Live enables you to create, transmit and view live stream audiovisual content. If you use POF Live please remind yourself of our rules on which content you may upload and ensure that you comply with those rules when carrying out any live streaming.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Viewers can use paid features such as gifts and special comments to show appreciation of quality of the live stream they are watching. For each paid feature sent by the viewer, the broadcaster get rewarded with tokens determined by POF acting in its reasonable discretion.</span></p>

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">How do Broadcasters Redeem Tokens?</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Tokens can be used to acquire credits to access POF’s premium services or to cash-out for actual currency should you meet certain conditions as detailed here in and in the cash-out rules accessible via your account.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Tokens are redeemable 90 days after being earned. The minimum amount required for cash-out and maximum amount of permissible cash out are detailed in the cash-out rules.</span></p>

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">The currency of cash-out will be determined by POF applying its then current exchange rate which it may change in its sole discretion. Cash-outs may be subject to deductions for refunds and or chargebacks. POF’s exchange rate may also change due to the fluctuating value of tokens, which may change between the time they were awarded and the time you decide to cash-out.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF may amend the value of any cash out or withhold any cash-out at its sole discretion.</span></p>

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">You must have an active PayPal account or bank account to cash-out. We will not make payment to sanctioned countries, nor will we collect revenue from sanctioned countries.</span></p>

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Your account will be linked to your user account when you cash-out and the payment will be processed following any cash-out request according to the terms of Paypal or your bank. The time until pay-out varies and depends on a number of factors including the terms of Paypal or your bank. Note that Paypal may place any funds in temporary hold where there is insufficient payment history. In such cases, please contact Paypal.</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">POF does not charge a withdrawal fee to cash-out, however transaction fees of Paypal or your bank or FX rates may apply.</span></p>

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">&#xa0;</span></p>
  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">Tax regulations may require POF to collect appropriate tax information from broadcasters or to withhold taxes from payouts in which case we reserve the right to freeze payouts or withhold such amounts as required by law.</span></p>

  <p style="margin:0pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12pt">We have undertaken a legitimate interests assessment. The outcome of this assessment is that, whilst it should not be necessary to obtain a clear consent from any third parties in your livestream content, we require you to notify all third parties prior to shooting the footage, and provide them with an adequate opportunity to be excluded themselves from the footage.

We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to POF. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to POF.
